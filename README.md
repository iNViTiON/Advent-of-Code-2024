## What is it?

<https://adventofcode.com/2024> in [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I've decided to try Rust, but I won't finish reading its [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) before AoC2024 and I haven't had a chance to try anything except just reading that book.

## How to execute

You can set up Rust yourself, but it’s easier to use a devcontainer.

Run the following command to execute the code:

```sh
cargo run {day} {…params}
```

Replace `{day}` with the specific day's number (e.g., `1`) and `…params` will vary depending on the day. Simply run the command, and it will provide more details about the required parameters.
